               <h3>Root Canals Explained</h3>
               <p>Root canal treatment removes infection and decay from deep within the tooth so it can last for a lifetime with proper care and restoration. After numbing the area and accessing the tooth, dentists eliminate the diseased or non-vital pulp tissue (blood vessels and nerves) that once supported the tooth.

<br>The root canals are then thoroughly cleaned, reshaped and sealed to prevent reinfection and ensure continued health and longevity of your natural tooth. Should any lingering infection persist after treatment, antibiotics may be provided to fully eliminate it before final restoration.

<br>A root canal allows you to keep your real tooth, avoiding the hassle and cost of dental implants or other prosthodontic solutions. The treated tooth continues functioning, chewing and smiling as it always has without discomfort or damage to the surrounding teeth and gums.

<br>When cared for properly after treatment, most patients experience life-long success rates of over 95% with root canal-treated teeth. While they may have a slightly increased risk of fracture, restorative procedures can minimize that concern.

<br>With a quality restoration like a dental crown placed after root canal treatment, little evidence of the procedure remains other than your full, natural smile. Root canals absolutely save teeth and do not 'cause pain' as some myths suggest - when performed by an experienced dentist using modern anesthetic techniques, patient comfort is a high priority.

<br>Only let myths steer you from saving your natural teeth when expert care and proper restorative solutions can have your smile looking and working as good as new for decades to come. Your dentist is committed to your oral health, comfort and satisfaction over the long-run. Don't hesitate to ask any questions to feel fully informed about your treatment options. Your smile is worth it!</p>

Floss daily to remove food and plaque between teeth.<br>Use fluoride mouthwash or rinse once per day to boost protection. Fluoride strengthens tooth enamel against acid attacks.

As acid assaults rise after each meal or snacking, fluoride defense stands vigil, reinforcement arriving to reinforce before damage can devastate.</span>
